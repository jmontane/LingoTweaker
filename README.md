# LingoTweaker

![LingoTweaker](https://fiduswriter.github.io/LingoTweaker/logo-wordmark.png)

LingoTweaker is a proofreader of numerous languages written in Rust, with bindings with 
Python and Node and compilable to WebAssembly.

LingoTweaker includes a port of the [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) 
proofreading engine and its rule data. Additional languages and improvements to existing 
languages will be added over time.

*LingoTweaker* is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by the
LanguageTool project, whose name and trademark belong to their owners. Upstream
references and licenses are kept.

- **Rust-first**: `cargo add lingotweaker` and embed the engine directly (`lt::Engine::check`).
- **v2 HTTP drop-in**: same `/v2/*` paths, parameters, and JSON schema, so existing
  clients switch without changes.
- **WebAssembly**: `lt-wasm` / the `lingotweaker-wasm` npm package runs the engine
  in the browser and Node from fetchable per-language data packs.
- **Vendored data**: everything needed at runtime is copied into `data/` with per-file
  sha256 provenance, pinned to one upstream commit (`upstream.json`).
- **Parity-driven**: the legacy `<example>` tests are the primary gate; a pinned
  Java build of the legacy engine provides differential fixtures.

## Quick start

```sh
cargo test --workspace                 # engine + data manifest + HTTP contract tests
cargo run -p lt-cli -- inventory --lang en
cargo run -p lt-cli -- examples --lang en --out en-examples.jsonl
cargo run -p lt-cli -- serve --addr 0.0.0.0:8081
curl -s localhost:8081/v2/languages
curl -s -X POST localhost:8081/v2/check -d 'text=Hello+world.&language=en-US'
```

The engine reads data from `LT_DATA_DIR` (a data directory or a `.pack`/
`.pack.gz` file), or `./data` when run inside the repository.

Build the minimal browser demo (needs `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)):

```sh
tools/wasm/build-demo.sh
python3 -m http.server -d crates/lt-wasm/www 8000
```

The full GitHub Pages demo (ProseMirror editor, all languages, rule settings)
lives in `demo/`:

```sh
demo/scripts/build.sh                  # wasm + data + Vite bundle
python3 -m http.server -d demo/dist 8000
```

## Workspace

| crate | purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `lt` | internal engine facade (not publishable: crates.io `lt` name is taken) |
| `lingotweaker` | publishable crates.io facade, `[lib] name = "lt"` |
| `lt-core` | core types: languages, matches, check results, offsets |
| `lt-tokenize` | sentence splitter + tokenizer (UTF-8 byte offsets) |
| `lt-tagger` | Morfologik FSA tagger (spike in progress) |
| `lt-disambig` | disambiguation XML interpreter |
| `lt-pattern` | XML pattern-rule engine |
| `lt-spell` | speller + confusion sets |
| `lt-data` | vendored-data discovery, manifest verification |
| `lt-http` | LT v2-compatible HTTP API (axum) |
| `lt-cli` | batch/JSON CLI, corpus extraction, parity workhorse |
| `lt-wasm` | wasm-bindgen bindings: browser engine over in-memory data packs |

PyO3 (`lt-py`) and napi-rs (`lt-node`) wrappers arrive in Phase 2.

## Data and upstream sync

`upstream.json` pins the upstream baseline commit. `data/manifest.json` records
every vendored file's upstream path, sha256, size, and license. External artifacts
(tagger/speller dictionaries, OpenNLP chunker models) are pinned Maven artifacts
recorded in `tools/lt-sync/lt_sync.py`. The data layout, generation workflow and
manifest schema are documented in `data/README.md`.

```sh
python3 tools/lt-sync/lt_sync.py baseline --upstream /path/to/languagetool
python3 tools/lt-sync/lt_sync.py import  --upstream /path/to/languagetool --artifacts /tmp/kilo/maven
python3 tools/lt-sync/lt_sync.py status  --upstream /path/to/languagetool
python3 tools/lt-sync/lt_sync.py report
```

Rule, category, and message ids are never renumbered.

## Installing releases

Prereleases are published from one version to crates.io, PyPI and npm:

```sh
cargo add lingotweaker@0.1.0-alpha.1          # Rust (library name stays `lt`)
pip install lingotweaker==0.1.0a1             # Python (module name `lt_py`)
pip install lingotweaker-data-en              # Python runtime data (per language)
npm install lingotweaker@next                 # Node.js
npm install lingotweaker-wasm@next            # Browser/Node WebAssembly
npm install lingotweaker-data-en              # Node.js runtime data (per language)
# `lingotweaker` and `lingotweaker-wasm` depend on the code-only
# `lingotweaker-data` loader; the packs ship in per-language
# `lingotweaker-data-<lang>` packages.
```

`lt` on crates.io is an unrelated third-party crate; the engine is published as
`lingotweaker` with `[lib] name = "lt"`, so `use lt::...` still works.
Prereleases use the npm `next` dist-tag and a PEP 440 prerelease version on
PyPI, so `latest` stays on the last stable release.

The engine packages ship **code only**. Runtime data is published separately
for every release:

- Python: `pip install lingotweaker-data-<lang>`; `lt_py` finds it
  automatically for a matching language.
- Node.js: `npm install lingotweaker-data-<lang>`; the `lingotweaker-data`
  loader dependency exposes `packPath("<lang>")`, which the native and wasm
  engines both read (a `.pack.gz` file).
- Rust/other: `LT_DATA_DIR` accepts either a data directory or a single
  `.pack`/`.pack.gz` file. Per-language packs and extractable native archives
  are attached to each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/fiduswriter/LingoTweaker/releases);
  `manifest.json` lists sizes and sha256 hashes.

Release tooling lives in `scripts/release/`; see `scripts/release/README.md`.

## License

Port and glue code: **LGPL-2.1-or-later** — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).
Vendored rule data, dictionaries and models keep their upstream licenses; the
component table (including licenses still to be confirmed) is
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), with per-file entries in
`data/manifest.json` and license texts in `licenses/README.md`.
